                                    The development of Impressionism was led
                                    by a group of painters including Claude Monet,
                                    Alfred Sisley, Pierre Auguste Renoir along  
                                    with other Paris-based artists from the 
                                    early 1860s. Impressionists realized 
                                    that rather than painting in a studio, 
                                    by painting quickly
                                    in the open air or in front of their subjects,
                                    they could capture the momentary and 
                                    transient effects of sunlight. This process 
                                    brought about a greater awareness of light and color
                                    and the shifting pattern of the natural scene.

                                    Monet was the leader of the movement. His brief brush strokes
                                    and fragmented color application made their way into the works
                                    of others. Monet showed special interest in the passage of time
                                    in his portrayal of light. Throughout his life,
                                    he expanded his Impressionist practice, culminating
                                    in his multiple studies of the Waterlily Pond produced
                                    from 1898 to 1926, of which the later works in the 
                                    series finished just before his death achieve an almost
                                    abstract quality.

                                    directed his studies of the effects of light on figures,
                                    primarily the female form instead of the scenary, mostly
                                    focusing on portraiture. Renoir favored the mundane
                                    realities of life as his subject matter and present
                                    an optimistic atmosphere in his paintings.

                                        <p>
                                            Le déjeuner sur l'herbe, translated as Luncheon on the Grass,
                                            was considered as the most controversial artwork of the 19th
                                            century. The explicit depiction of nudity in a contemporary
                                            setting induced outrage and scorn from high-minded salon
                                            juries as well as middle-class audiences of the era. Nevertheless,
                                            this work earned Manet fame and patronage.

                                        Monet's Impression Sunrise is sometimes cited as the

                                        It was the critic Louis Leroy's derogatory comments
                                        on this work and its title, as a satirical review
                                        of the First Impressionist Exhibition of 1874,
                                        that gave life to the term "Impressionism".

                                    <p>
                                        Like most Impressionist paintings, this work was deemed as
                                        scandalous when it was first exhibited. This scene presents two 
                                        unfortunate individuals slumped on a bench outside a Parisian 
                                        café and conveys a deep sense of isolation and degradation, 
                                        uncovering another side to the Impressionists' emphasis
                                        on truth to life.

                                    <h5>Paris Street, Rainy Day (1877) by Gustave Caillebotte</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        The work of Gustave Caillebotte adheres to a distinct Realist
                                        aesthetic. However, it also refelcts a concern with modern
                                        life, which was central to Impressionism. Similar to 
                                        Caillebotte's other works, this painting explores the
                                        effect of modernity on the human psyche, fleeting impressions
                                        of the street, and the result of the ever changing urban
                                        sphere upon society.

                                    <p>
                                        Plenty of Mary Cassatt's paintings gives emphasis on the
                                        surroundings and citizens of Paris under Haussmanization,
                                        but also giving special attention towards the private
                                        and public lives of women. At the Opera is Cassatt's
                                        depiction of the recently-built Palais Garnier of the
                                        Paris Opera which was the social hub for the upper classes
                                        of the city.

                                    <p>
                                        Sometime during the mid 1880s, Renoir was commissioned to paint
                                        a potrait of a nine-year-old girl named Marie Goujon. In this work,
                                        Renoir incorporates a new style, "aigre" which is translated as "sour",
                                        inspired by the work of Renaissance painters, which indicates a
                                        new emphasis on hardness and clarity of form.

                                        Boulevard Montmartre, Afternoon applies the techniques of 
                                        his earlier plein-air landscapes to the modern city. The work uses 
                                        broad strokes of paint, carefully applied to the canvas, to 
                                        represent the fleeting nature of modern life, and the visual 
                                        impression made by the metropolis.

                                        Whistler's Nocturne: Blue and Gold is known as one of the most dazzling works of the wider 
                                        Impressionist movement. It was produced at the time of urban
                                        reconstruction in London, and portrays the old Battersea Bridge
                                        found in the south of the city from a riverbank perspective,
                                        along with the lights of the newer Albert Bridge blinking in the
                                        background as rockets cascade from the sky.
